NurSchedule 🩺📅

An AI-powered nurse scheduling system that lets nurses book, change, or cancel shifts using natural language input. No more phone calls or clunky forms - just type requests like:

"Book me off next Friday"

"Schedule me for Monday evening"

"Drop my night shift on Aug 5"

🚀 Inspiration

During COVID-19, we saw how outdated scheduling systems put extra strain on nurses. One teammate’s mom still had to call a receptionist to manage shifts - inefficient and error-prone. We wanted to build a tool that makes scheduling simple, fast, and intelligent.
